# PortfolioExampleAPI
This repository contains an example API I wrote as part of a Label Printer Application.

## Example API
![Swagger Endpoints](https://github.com/makalkas/PortfolioExampleAPI/blob/main/Images/SwaggerEndpoints.png)

### Example Code
![Sample Constructor](https://github.com/makalkas/PortfolioExampleAPI/blob/main/Images/Typical%20Constructor.png)
> [!NOTE]
> XML comments require less bouncing betwee code defenitions to understand what is happening in the code.

### Example Broker Code
![Broker Methods](https://github.com/makalkas/PortfolioExampleAPI/blob/main/Images/API_Broker.png)
> [!NOTE]
> I use _"regions"_ to allow a developer to hide code that might distract them while they are working on code.

### Example Partial Class Method
